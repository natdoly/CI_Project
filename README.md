# Cloud Integration
Nathan DOLY - Lisa RAOUL - M2 Digital transformation - Cloud Integration Project

# Context

Our chosen scenario was the development of an Eshop, an online clothing store featuring both discounted and non-discounted items.

# What is inside ?

In this project, which represents an eshop, we used different integration patterns to carry out various operations on our data from the clothing store.

# How to launch the project ?

All you have to do is execute the function you want in main.java, uncomment it and see the result (depending on whether the result is in a file or not).
